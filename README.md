Campus Building Directory System

The Campus Building Directory System is a web-based application developed using Django and managed in PyCharm. This system is designed specifically for Cavite State University – Bacoor Campus to help users easily locate buildings, floors, rooms, and assigned personnel across the campus.

The system allows users to search buildings, rooms, offices, and personnel through a simple and user-friendly interface. Each room includes detailed information such as its type, description, assigned personnel, and clear directions on how to get there from the main entrance. Images are also provided to help users visually identify locations.

In addition to the standard directory view, the system features an interactive 3D Campus View. Users can click on a building, select a floor, and then choose a room to view its details. This visual approach helps users better understand the campus layout and navigate more efficiently.

The project also includes a Django Admin Panel, where authorized administrators can manage all directory data. Admin users can add, update, and delete buildings, floors, rooms, personnel, and search logs without modifying the source code.

Overall, this project aims to improve campus navigation and accessibility by providing accurate, organized, and easy-to-understand information for students, staff, and visitors of CvSU Bacoor Campus.
